My area of interest include agricultural economics, applied econometrics, public policy and development economics.\r\nBefore coming to Cornell, I received B.S. from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I worked as a research assistant at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and Yale University, and as a consultant at Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) at the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Hoddinott - Early View at American Journal of Agricultural Economics\r\nAbstract: We study household food security dynamics in the United States from 2001 to 2017 using a new measure, the probability of food security (PFS), the estimated probability that a household’s food expenditures equal or exceed the minimum cost of a healthful diet. We use PFS to analyze household-level and subpopulation-scale dynamics by investigating the conditional distribution of estimated food insecurity spells and the chronic and transient components of estimated food insecurity. We find that two-thirds of households experienced no estimated food insecurity during the 2001-17 period and more than half of newly food insecure households regain food security within two years. Households headed by female, non-White, or less educated individuals disproportionately suffer persistent, chronic and/or severe food insecurity.\r\nWorking Papers\r\nThe Probability of Food Security: A new longitudinal data set using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.\r\nWith John H.

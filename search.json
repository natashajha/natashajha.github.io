I am a postdoctoral research associate with the Ford Program in Human Development Studies and Solidarity at the Kellogg Institute For International Studies. I received my PhD from Cornell University in 2023.\nI am a development economist whose research primarily focuses on human capital formation, gender, and the role of institutions. Some of my research also examines price distortions and environmental externalities associated with agricultural policies.\n\n\n\n",

Testing the theoretical argument that alcohol has differential effects on different kinds of crime, we used a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach and found that the prohibition led to a 0.22 standard deviation point reduction in the reported incidence of violent crimes but had no significant impact on nonviolent crimes. The effect is fairly persistent over time, with the initial impact being large enough that, on average, there is a reduction in violent crime over at least a three-year period following the ban. Heterogeneity tests revealed that the effect on crime was stronger in interior districts and districts with higher baseline alcohol consumption. We also observed stronger effects in districts where a smaller proportion of the population faced religious restrictions on alcohol consumption. Since all these subgroups indicate districts where the ban is likely to have had a larger effect on alcohol availability and consumption, we conclude that the ban affects crime through this channel rather than that of institutional changes.\nWorking Papers\nSocial Norms and Human Capital Investment: Examining the Educational Impacts of Dowry in Rural India\nAbstract: This paper examines the consequences of sticky social norms for investments in human capital in the context of dowry payments and educational attainment. Using data from rural India the paper tests for educational impacts of a change in dowry payments brought about by the 1985 amendment to the Dowry Prohibition Act. The empirical strategy uses a Difference-in-differences design along with variation in exposure to the amendment by religion. Findings document a 18% reduction in education as well dowry paid for exposed females post amendment. Households that experienced the most change in dowry payments exhibit the largest declines in years of education. Dowry and education are considered as signals communicating adherence to traditional norms to explain these results. Declines in educational attainment increase with increases in enforcement capacity, consistent with a backlash against challenged social norms.\nGender differences in tertiary healthcare\nWith Tarun Jain and Revathy Suryanarayana\nAbstract: We examine gender differences in access to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare program in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data from the program to estimate gender differences in access and services. We classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the time for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the amount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression framework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics, the type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making gender comparisons.\nThe Political Economy of Minimum Support Prices\nWith Shilpa Aggarwal and Ishani Chatterjee\nAbstract:While the distortions from price controls are well-understood in theory, these may be underestimated if the controls are captured for uses beyond fixing market failures. We study this issue in the context of minimum support prices (MSP), the government of India’s procurement price of food grains. We find that when a district with a historically larger area under cultivation for a crop is slated to go for elections, the central government announces a higher MSP for that crop. Since government procurement price is the same across the country, the center uses this blunt instrument only when other policy instruments are unavailable, i.e., when the incumbent state government is not aligned with the center. Even small increases in MSP can have large welfare effects as the central government spent nearly 1% of the GDP on procurement in 2020-21.\n\n\n\n",

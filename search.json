I am a postdoctoral research associate with the Ford Program in Human Development Studies and Solidarity at the Kellogg Institute For International Studies. I received my PhD from Cornell University in 2023.\nI am a development economist whose research primarily focuses on human capital formation, gender, and the role of institutions. Some of my research also examines price distortions and environmental externalities associated with agricultural policies.\n\n\n\n",

Testing the theoretical argument that alcohol has differential effects on different kinds of crime, we used a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach and found that the prohibition led to a 0.22 standard deviation point reduction in the reported incidence of violent crimes but had no significant impact on nonviolent crimes. The effect is fairly persistent over time, with the initial impact being large enough that, on average, there is a reduction in violent crime over at least a three-year period following the ban. Heterogeneity tests revealed that the effect on crime was stronger in interior districts and districts with higher baseline alcohol consumption. We also observed stronger effects in districts where a smaller proportion of the population faced religious restrictions on alcohol consumption. Since all these subgroups indicate districts where the ban is likely to have had a larger effect on alcohol availability and consumption, we conclude that the ban affects crime through this channel rather than that of institutional changes.\nWorking Papers\nShow Me the Dowry: How Traditional Customs Affect Education in Rural India\nAbstract: This study examines the impact of a law that increased penalties for dowry on rural households’ educational attainment in India, using data from the Rural Economic and Demographic Survey. A difference-in-differences approach reveals that the law reduced dowry payments and female education, with the decline in female education being most pronounced in communities with higher dowry prevalence. This suggests that dowry payments signal adherence to tradition, and reducing female education serves as an alternative signal in the absence of dowry. Hence, while the law combats an exploitative custom, it inadvertently depletes female human capital.\nGender differences in tertiary healthcare\nWith Tarun Jain and Revathy Suryanarayana\nAbstract: We examine gender differences in access to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare program in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data from the program to estimate gender differences in access and services. We classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the time for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the amount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression framework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics, the type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making gender comparisons.\nMinimum Support Prices in Indian Agriculture: Supporting Whom and at What Price?\nWith Shilpa Aggarwal and Ishani Chatterjee\nAbstract:Distortions introduced by price-controls may be underestimated if controls are captured for uses beyond fixing market failures. We study India’s minimum support prices (MSP) for food grains, and find that when a district with a larger area under cultivation for a crop is slated to go for elections, the central government announces a higher MSP for that crop. Since government procurement price is the same across states, this blunt instrument is used more when other policy instruments are unavailable, i.e., when the incumbent state government is unaligned with the center. Higher MSP directly reduces welfare via pass-through to consumer prices.\n\n\n\n",
